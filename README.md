# ossindex-eclipse

An Eclipse plugin that uses the JAVA API to provide functionality related to the OSS Index. The current roadmap includes:

- [x] Highlight all files that are found in OSS Index
- [ ] Identify file owners where possible
- [ ] Allow user to submit file owner information
- [ ] Identify package dependencies for supported package managers
- [ ] List known vulnerabilities of dependencies within the problem view as "errors"
- [ ] List recent vulnerabilities of dependencies within the problem view as "warnings" (not known to be impacting identified versions)

More is sure to come as things develop over the next couple of months.
